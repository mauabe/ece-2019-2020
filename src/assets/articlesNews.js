Then there are odds and ends to remove, as well as wiring issues to address. The two most useful tools you’ll need for the demo process are a power drill and an angle grinder. For hand tools, you should have a standard and a metric set of socket wrenches, a combination wrench set, screwdrivers, a pry bar, and a couple pairs of locking pliers. Most seat bolts are corroded or have a nut under the bus that turns with the bolt. Instead of using a wrench, aim your angle grinder cutting wheel at the base of the bolts at a slight angle to slice into the bolt. Removing the wall panels in your bus can be as easy as unscrewing a ton of Phillips screws or as challenging as grinding or drilling out a ton of rivets. Regardless, remove the original thin metal interior siding to inspect for rust, allow for better insulation, and open up options for custom wall paneling. </p><p>   Demolishing the original ceiling panels is done exactly the same way as the wall panels. A lot of air temperature is lost and gained through the ceiling, so you might want to replace the old insulation with newer, more efficient insulation.Floor Prep / The original floor needs to go. You don’t want to build your skoolie over a floor that may be rotted and rusty. And removing the original floor allows you to add a new insulated surface to help maintain a comfortable temperature inside. Insulation also cuts down on road noise. Most school buses have a top floor layer of thick rubber over 1⁄2-inch or 3⁄4-inch plywood that sits on top of the primary metal floor. As you get the rubber to pull up, you can grab it and peel it back by hand. It helps to have someone prying along the bottom edge of the rubber as you pull. Next, remove the plywood layer. The plywood is usually glued to the metal in various shapes and sizes. The pry bar is your tool of choice for this step, and a second pry bar doesn’t hurt. Once you pry up an edge of each plywood piece, you can begin pulling the wood up by hand. </p><p>    Many of the smaller demo items—alarms, speakers, lights—involve wiring. In many cases, you can remove an item that has wiring running to it and simply cap off each wire with a wire nut. Sometimes, however, wiring configurations are interconnected with the bus’s starting system, so make sure the bus starts up after each wiring change. If the bus fails to start, you’ll know which wire(s) caused the problem. Overhead speakers were originally used for intercom systems, but they can be connected to a stereo. You may opt to leave these speakers in place, replace them with higher-quality units, or simply cover them up. Another option is to replace them with lights, which requires replacing the cabling (12- or 14-gauge wiring is sufficient for most 12-volt lighting). </p><p>    The passenger heaters use coolant from the engine to generate heat that radiates into the passenger area. You first have to disconnect the coolant input and output hoses and connect them together to bypass the heater. You make the connection with a barbed union fitting for hoses. Underneath the bus, below where the heater is located, you will see two black hoses going up through the bus floor and connecting to the bottom inputs of the heater with clamps. Use locking pliers to pinch the hoses closed, clamping the pliers a couple inches away from the ends so there’s room to fit on the barbed union. Then loosen the hose clamp on the input hose with a flat-head screwdriver and slip the clamp out of the way. Pull the hose from the heater input. Insert one end of the barbed union all the way into the open end of the hose, and secure the hose over the union with the clamp. Repeat this step with the other hose from the heater to connect it to the other end of the union. Be prepared for coolant spillage and have a 5-gallon bucket handy to catch any coolant that spills from inside the heater. </p><p>    With your bus gutted and the interior surface materials out of the way, you now have a much clearer view of any rust and corrosion issues, and you’re ready to prepare your blank canvas for its new finishes. You’ll start with the floor, which usually needs the most work, then you’ll seal up the walls and windows, and finish with a quick check of the ceiling. Surface rust on the floor will be easy to handle in most cases: Bus floors are thick, and there is enough metal there that you can grind off superficial rust spots with a wire brush and still have a very solid surface. </p><p>    Start cleaning the floor with a wire brush attached to an angle grinder or drill to remove dirt, grime, glue, and surface rust; then vacuum up the debris. Treat the rusted areas that don’t need patching with a rust converter. I like POR-15 and have found that a 1-pint kit from POR-15 works well for a midsize bus with an average amount of surface rust.If you find areas with large flakes of rust and the floor feels soft or flexes as you put weight on it, you have a more serious rust issue. Test to see how solid the rust spot is by poking it with a screwdriver. If the screwdriver goes through the floor, you will need to cut away the rusted metal with a grinder, then patch the hole with new metal. If the hole is smaller than 5 inches, you can patch over it with thin scrap metal and metal adhesive, such as JB Weld. Make sure the patch is a few inches larger than the hole so there’s plenty of margin for adhesive. Holes 5 inches or larger should be covered with a welded patch that is flush with the floor rather than resting or overlapping on top of the surrounding metal. </p>  '

    textCopy: '<p  style="text-indent:0;"><span class="first-letter"> Computers </span> are becoming increasingly pervasive and critical in our lives due to the rise of embedded devices and cyber-physical systems. While these systems are performing their primary task: computing, they create unwanted footprints that can leak potentially sensitive information about the system through unconventional channels called side-channels. With the ever-increasing reliance on computing systems, it is important to deeply understand how these side-channel signals can be created, how side-channel leakage can be mitigated (and even leveraged for useful applications), and how future systems should be designed to be robust against side-channel attacks.</p><p>     As a researcher in the area of computer architecture and hardware security, my research was mainly focused on proposing new methods to a) discover, model, and mitigate side-channel signals on modern systems and b) leverage side-channel signals for useful purposes (e.g., profiling, intrusion detection, establishing trust) to improve the security and/or performance of resource-constrained devices such as embedded and cyber-physical systems. My work on leveraging analog-domain side-channel signals for profiling, having received the prestigious Best Paper Award at MICRO-49, is the first of its kind and has created a new area for research in computer architecture.</p><p>      Moving forward, I will continue to investigate new methods for mitigating side-channels to design secure architectures for future systems and emerging technologies such as cyber-physical systems, domain-specific accelerators, and persistent memories. Moreover, building upon my current work, I am planning to expand my research into emerging topics: Remote Computation, Privacy-Preserving Computing, and Trustworthy AI.</p></br><p>       Bio: Nader Sehatbakhsh is an assistant professor at UCLA. His research interest is on the broad area of Security and Privacy with emphasis on hardware support for security and privacy. Specifically, he is interested in computer architecture, IoT Security, embedded/cyber-physical systems, side-channels, trusted computing and hardware enclaves, and security and privacy in machine learning. His work has been published in top venues such as MICRO, ISCA, and HPCA, and has been recognized with several awards and honors including the MICRO-49 Best Paper Award and Micro Top-Picks Honorable Mention.  </p><p>       He earned a Ph.D. in Computer Science from Georgia Tech\'s  School of Computer Science, where he worked on Securing Computing Systems by Mitigating and Leveraging Side-Channels.
