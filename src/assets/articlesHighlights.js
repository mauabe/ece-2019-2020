Kaiser, Distinguished Professor at Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, to its College of Fellows. Election to the AIMBE College of Fellows is among the highest professional distinctions accorded to a medical and biological engineer. The College of Fellows is comprised of the top two percent of medical and biological engineers. <p></p> College membership honors those who have made outstanding contributions to “engineering and medicine research, practice, or education” and to “the pioneering of new and developing fields of technology, making major advancements in traditional fields of medical and biological engineering, or developing/implementing innovative approaches to bioengineering education."<p></p> Dr. Kaiser was nominated, reviewed, and elected by peers and members of the College of Fellows for “seminal contributions to development and commercialization of networked biomedical sensors and analytics enabling the field of wireless health monitoring.“<p></p>  Professor Kaiser received a PhD in Solid State Physics from Wayne State University in 1984. From 1977 through 1986, as a member of Ford Motor Co. Research Staff, his development of automotive sensor and embedded system technology resulted in large volume commercial sensor production. At Ford, he also developed the first spectroscopies based on scanning tunneling microscopy. From 1986 through 1994, at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Dr. Kaiser developed and demonstrated the first electron tunnel sensors for acceleration and infrared detection and initiated the NASA/JPL microinstrument program.<p></p>   In 1994, Professor Kaiser joined the faculty of the UCLA Electrical Engineering Department. At UCLA, he initiated the distributed networked embedded sensor field via many large collaborative programs across several departments. These combined UCLA research activities have now lead to the creation of many new programs within DARPA, NSF, NASA, and in commercial technology corporations.<p></p>    Working in close collaboration with the UCLA community he has developed UCLA Wireless Health Institute (WHI). WHI development includes products focused on advancing patient outcomes, promoting health and wellness, creating new healthcare delivery methods, and also advancing human performance. The WHI development of the AbStats Digestive Monitor received the Plenary Paper Award at the 2015 Digestive Disease Week conference. The WHI development of the SEM Scanner product now on the market in the EU and UK received the Frost & Sullivan Innovative European Medical Device Award for 2015. <p></p>  Professor Kaiser served as Electrical Engineering Department Chairman from 1996 through 2000. Dr. Kaiser has over 100 publications, 100 invited presentations and 21 patents. He has received the Allied Signal Faculty Research Award, the Peter Mark Award of the American Vacuum Society, the NASA Medal for Exceptional Scientific Achievement, the Arch Colwell Best Paper Award of the Society of Automotive Engineers, and two R&D 100 Awards. </p>  '

Then there are odds and ends to remove, as well as wiring issues to address. The two most useful tools you’ll need for the demo process are a power drill and an angle grinder. For hand tools, you should have a standard and a metric set of socket wrenches, a combination wrench set, screwdrivers, a pry bar, and a couple pairs of locking pliers. Most seat bolts are corroded or have a nut under the bus that turns with the bolt. Instead of using a wrench, aim your angle grinder cutting wheel at the base of the bolts at a slight angle to slice into the bolt. Removing the wall panels in your bus can be as easy as unscrewing a ton of Phillips screws or as challenging as grinding or drilling out a ton of rivets. Regardless, remove the original thin metal interior siding to inspect for rust, allow for better insulation, and open up options for custom wall paneling. </p><p>       Start cleaning the floor with a wire brush attached to an angle grinder or drill to remove dirt, grime, glue, and surface rust; then vacuum up the debris. Treat the rusted areas that don’t need patching with a rust converter. I like POR-15 and have found that a 1-pint kit from POR-15 works well for a midsiith new metal. If the hole is smaller than 5 inches, you can patch over it with thin scrap metal and metal adhesive, such as JB Weld. Make sure the patch is a few inches larger than the hole so there’s plenty of margin for adhesive. Holes 5 inches or larger should be covered with a welded patch that is flush with the floor rather than resting or overlapping on top of the surrounding metal. </p>  '
