    <p>The Electrical and Computer Engineering ­Department has been forging new partnerships with industry over the past year with its ­Electrical and Computer Engineering Partnerships (ECEP) ­program. The program tightly ­couples ­academic education and research with the needs of industry by ­working ­directly with ­partners in nurturing our pipelines of talent both at the undergraduate and graduate levels. We enhance ­visibility to our student activities with ­industry through open houses and ­research reviews, and we propagate ­industry needs with our students through hands-on ­projects, material in courses, ­industry lecturers, and collaborative ­research opportunities. ECEP also provides linkages for partners to access UCLA’s state-of-the-art facilities. These ­activities are ­possible through the support of our ­partners. More details are available at the ECEP website: <span class="link"><a>https://www.ee.ucla.edu/industry.</a></span></p>
